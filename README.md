# ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Price ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL

This project is a real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches stock prices using Yahoo Finance, computes 7-day moving averages, and loads the processed data into a PostgreSQL database. The entire workflow is orchestrated using Apache Airflow and runs every 15 minutes.
